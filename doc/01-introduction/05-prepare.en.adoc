== Installation and Preparation Requirements

=== Arduino IDE

*Step 1*: install the Arduino software.

Download and install Arduino IDE from arduino's homepage. Link donwload:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.

Depending on the operating system, you may choose the appropriate installation package.

*Step 2*: Install the toolkit, compiler, SDK. That supports the ESP8266 chip in the Arudino IDE.

With this toolkit, we can easily program, compile, and use libraries for the ESP8266 directly on the Arduino IDE. Open Arduino IDE in the menu bar, select `File` -> `Preferecens`, in `settings` tab, you need to choose optionsthe options like the image below:

.Add the ESP8266 board information file
image::01-intro/preferences.png[Thêm file hỗ trợ cài đặt board ESP8266, align="center", width=400]

`Sketchbook location` is the path, which you want to save the sketch (program file), On the Unix-like systems the default path is: `/home/name_your_computer/Arduino`. This will also be the location of the libraries that we will add later.

In the `Additional Board Manager URLs field`, enter path `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`.

*Step 3*: Install ESP8266 board.

Open `Boards Manager` in the `Tools` on menu bar -> find the board you want to use with keyword `Generic 8266` -> select the board ti install as image below and click install.

.Install ESP8266 board

[[install-library]]
=== Install arduino library

Some libraries published by other developers, you can install it directly using Arduino's Library Manager.

Start the arduino IDE and select the item `Sketch` => `include library` => `Manage libraries`:

.start the library Manager

In the `libbrary manager` , you need to enter the contents of the library in the textbox, select the version, and then press `install`, the installed libraries will have the text `INSTALLED` displayed at the top of each library.
For example, we will find the OLED library related to ESP8266 as shown below::

.install library

=== USB CDC driver.

The ESP8266 WiFi Uno board is connected to the computer via a USB MicroB and uses the chip **CH340** to convert USB to UART. Therefore, you need to install USB driver software to communicate with the board.

Connect the USB cable to the board, making sure the LEDs in the circle the light as shown below:

.Connect USB

==== Windows & Linux

Download the USB driver installation for Windows http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_ZIP.html and Linux http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341PAR_LINUX_ZIP.html . Follow the installation requirements.
After installation, the result is displayed on the Arduino as image

.Connection succeeded

==== Mac OS

Download the installation: https://arduino.esp8266.vn/_static/download/CH34x_Install_V1.3.pkg

For **Mac OS Sierra** and later versions if you have problems with RESET your machine, you need to handle the following:

* Open "Terminal" `cmd + space` --> Enter Terminal
* delete driver: `sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/usb.kext`
* With some machines, you have to do extra work `sudo rm -rf /Library/Extensions/usbserial.kext`
* If you can not do the command above, you need to change `Security and Privacy` in `System Preference`. Select `Allow Apps Downloaded From` form `Mac App Store and Identified Developers` to `Anywhere` - and download https://arduino.esp8266.vn/_static/download/CH34x_Install_V1.3.pkg[CH34x_Install_V1.3.pkg] to install again.

.Select Allow Apps Downloaded From Anywhere

[[select-arduino-board]]
=== Select Board ESP8266 WiFi Uno in Arduino IDE

After the connection and installation are complete, a virtual COM port will appear on your computer. (Depending on the type of operating system that has port names like `COM1`, `COM2` ... for Windows, `/dev/tty.wchusbserial1420` on Mac OS, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux)
Open Arduino IDE and select (refer to connection configuration as image below):

. Select the configuration for the ESP8266 WiFi Uno Board
image::01-intro/port-setup.png[Cấu hình Board ESP8266 WiFi Uno, align="center", width=400]

* Board: `Generic ESP8266 Module`.
* Flash Size: `4M (3M SPIFFS)`.
* Port: Select the port when the device plugged
* Upload speed: choose the highest speed, if the computer loaded program is faulty, we will choose the lower speed.

[[arduino-flash]]
=== Load the program file into the board using the Arduino IDE

On the Arduino interface there are two buttons, the leftmost is the `Verify` button, for compiling the program, which is equivalent to the `Sketch> Verify / Compile` function. The next button is `Upload`, which is equivalent to the function `Sketch> Upload`. After selecting the appropriate board, the program has no errors, then click `Upload` to load the program into the board.

[[export-binary]]
=== export firmware binary in Arduino IDE
If we need a `binary file` , we can export the file by `Sketch> Export compiled Binary`, and the .bin file will be in the Sketch folder.

.Export Binary file

=== Serial Terminal

There are many free applications to interact with the Serial port on your computer:

* Windows: PuTTY, realterm
* Linux: minicom, screen
* MacOS: minicom, screen

[[arudino-term]]
==== using Arduino IDE Serial Monitor

Arduino has a built-in Serial Monitor, when you select the correct Serial port, you can press the Serial icon on the IDE to open:

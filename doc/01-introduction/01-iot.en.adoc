=== What is Internet of Things (IoT)?

[quote, Wikipedia]
Internet of Things (IoT) - The Internet of things is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to connect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure.

Internet of Things (IoT) refers to objects that can be identified as well as their existence in a connected, interconnected architecture: a network of things connected to the Internet, or simply `Things`.

IoT can be a sensor that is assembled in a refrigerator to record temperature, is a heart transplanted in the human body,...Understandably, IoT makes things easier to communicate with each other The biggest advantage of `smart` is the ability to prevent and warn anywhere.

The term "the Internet of things" was coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999, after that, it was used extensively in publications by manufacturers and analysts. They identified IoT as a complex system, because it contains many connections between machines, equipment and services. Initially, IoT was not meant to be automatic and intelligent. Later, it was thought to combine the two concepts IoT - Autonomous control together. It can observe change and feedback with the surroundings, also can control itself without network connection. Integrating intelligence into IoT can also help devices, machines and software collect and analyze human electronic data when we interact with them. In the future, people will be able to communicate with machines via wireless internet without any additional intermediaries.

The question is, what helps IoT "smart" and "understand" people? Initially, people thought that the Internet of things was primarily about M2M communication (devices connected via another device). But when it comes to "intelligence", It's not just M2M communication that we need to mention the sensors. And do not be mistaken that the Sensor is a machine that operates under the control of other devices that are essentially similar to human eyes and ears with continuous recognition of measurements. After all, Internet of Things provides a connection between machines and sensors, and the cloud data to encrypt data. Cloud computing applications are the key to making Internet of Things work by analyzing, processing and using the data the sensors collect.

In the world today, the impact of the IOT is diverse and active in many areas: infrastructure management, health, construction and automation, transportation .... John Chambers (CEO of Cisco) announced: By 2024 there will be 500 billion connected devices. In fact, this number is nearly 100 times greater than the number of people on Earth, That shows that `things` are more than people very much. We all know the IoT application can `talk` to people through the keyboard, and the device is also designed with more and more sensors to communicate in the fastest and most accurate way, it help to collect simple data from each of us. But most importantly, although it communicates with humans, the IoT application is not human.
The people said that IoT is the key to success, it is the turning point and great opportunity of the future. In order not to fall behind, governments and businesses need to innovate and invest more aggressively in developing products that apply Internet of things technology.

IoT systems allow users to achieve deeper automation, analysis, and integration within a system. They improve the reach of these areas and their accuracy. IoT utilizes existing and emerging technology for sensing, networking, and robotics.

IoT exploits recent advances in software, falling hardware prices, and modern attitudes towards technology. Its new and advanced elements bring major changes in the delivery of products, goods, and services; and the social, economic, and political impact of those changes.

==== IoT − Key Features

The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below:

- *AI (Artifical Intelligence)* - H IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect of life with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks. This can mean something as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect when milk and your favorite cereal run low, and to then place an order with your preferred grocer.
- *Connectivity* - New enabling technologies for networking, and specifically IoT networking, mean networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these small networks between its system devices.
- *Sensors* - IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments which transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world integration.
- *Active Engagement* Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens through passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement.
- *Small Devices* - Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility.

==== IoT − Advantages

The advantages of IoT span across every area of lifestyle and business. Here is a list of some of the advantages that IoT has to offer:

- *Improved Customer Engagement* - Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and significant flaws in accuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.
- *Technology Optimization* - The same technologies and data which improve the customer experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.

- *Reduced Waste* - IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to more effective management of resources.

- *Enhanced Data Collection* - Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces, and places it exactly where humans really want to go to analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.

==== IoT − Disadvantages

Though IoT delivers an impressive set of benefits, it also presents a significant set of challenges. Here is a list of some its major issues:

- *Security* - IoT creates an ecosystem of constantly connected devices communicating over networks. The system offers little control despite any security measures. This leaves users exposed to various kinds of attackers.
- *Privacy* - The sophistication of IoT provides substantial personal data in extreme detail without the user's active participatSome find IoT systems complicated in terms of design, deployment, and maintenance given their use of multiple technologies and a large set of new enabling technologies.
- *Flexibility* - Many are concerned about the flexibility of an IoT system to integrate easily with another. They worry about finding themselves with several conflicting or locked systems.
- *Compliance* - IoT, like any other technology in the realm of business, must comply with regulations. Its complexity makes the issue of compliance seem incredibly challenging when many consider standard software compliance a battle.

== ESP8266

ESP8266 is a cheap WiFi 2.4Ghz compatible SoC which is manufactured by a Chinese semiconductor company: Espressif Systems.

It was initially designed in August 2017, packed in a ESP-07 module which was manufactured by a third-party: AI-Thinker. It comes with the ability to connect to the Internet through WiFi network with decent speed, consumes little energy and requires less external components. ESP8266 has a good ratio of cost to performance.

ESP8266 now has a large community worldwide, providing various modules bundled with open source codes, which are user-friendly and cut time-to-market.

At the time of writing, ESP8266EX is the standard in the ESP8266 family.

=== Officially supported SDK

Espressif now has 3 separate SDKs, which are **NONOS SDK**, **RTOS SDK**, and **Arduino**. All 3 have their own perks, suitable for particular purposes and they use similar HAL APIs. At the moment, **Arduino** are widely used due to its ease-of-use, good software structure and making good use of libraries.

==== ESP8266 NONOS SDK

**NONOS SDK** since version **2.0.0** is fairly stable and provides almost all functions that ESP8266 is capable of:

* APIs for Timer, System, Wifi, reading\writing SPI Flash, Sleep and hardware peripherals: GPIO, SPI, I²C, PWM, I²S với DMA.
* `Smartconfig`: Support for fast configuration of Wi-Fi.
* `Sniffer` API: Wireless packet capture at 2.4Ghz.
* `SNTP` API: Time syncing with a Time Server.
* `WPA2 Enterprise` API: Provide a management system for WiFi by using accounts form RADIUS servers.
* `TCP/UDP` API: Allows for Internet connection and supports for protocols such as: HTTP, MQTT, CoAP.
* `mDNS` API: Locating the **IP** of devices in a network using hostname.
* `MESH` API: Connecting ESP8266 modules in a mesh.
* `FOTA` API: Firmware Over The Air.
* `ESP-Now` API: Using wirelessly transmitted data package at 2.4GHz to communicate directly with other ESP8266s without an Access Point.
* `Simple Pair` API: Set up a secured connection between two devices.

==== ESP8266 RTOS SDK

**RTOS SDK** has **FreeRTOS** at its core, and almost all **NON OS** SDK APIs are compatible with **RTOS SDK**.

=== ESP8285

ESP8285 is a successor of ESP8266EX, they are identical except ESP8225 has an 1 MiB internal Flash, rendering SPI FLASH obsolete and in turns reducing size and manufacturing cost.

=== Module and development board

ESP8266 needs at least 7 extra components for proper functionality, one of which is antenna. The antenna requires top-notch equipments for manufacturing and testing. For that reason, many modules and development boards are pre-built to work out-of-the-box.

=== ESP8266 development board

ESP8266 module includes only ESP8266 chip and other extra components; however, to function properly, we need to *program* it before putting it into operation. This process is called programming binary firmware (pre-conpiled on the computer) to the ESP8266 Flash.
To put ESP8266 in *Program* mode, *GPIO0* needs connecting to logic 0 (0V - GND) while RESETing the chip. Then the chip is ready for programming.

Most development boards have a buil-in programmer, which means they will automatically configure DRT and RTS of USB CDC, put the chip in progamming mode, then download the firmware. Arduino IDE does the same thing, it will tweak all options in accordance with the reported board.

TIP: If you are a beginner and do not know much about hardware, it'd be best to use a development board with built-in programmer. When you start designing the hardware for your project, it'll then be preferable to use a separate programmer cost-wise. These circuits are easy to find.

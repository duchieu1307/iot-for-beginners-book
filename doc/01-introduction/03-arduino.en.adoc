== What is Arduino?

https://arduino.cc[*Arduino*] is an IDE with integrated editor, compiler, and programmer along with firmwares, pre-built libraries for ease of use. The language of use of `C/C++`. Everything is a collective effort of the community around it. Its philosophy and desgin aim at beginners, amateurs. However, its quality `C/C++` compiler and excellent libraries are what make Arduino popular and on the same league with other professional compilers.

One advocate of **Arduino** was initially AVR, but gradually lots of other vendors like **ARM, PIC, STM32** and recently https://arduino.esp8266.vn[*ESP8266*], https://esp32.vn[*ESP32*], http://riscv.vn[*RISCV*] also joined in bringing in more powerful hardware and software capabilities.


=== Some of Arduino's features

* Arduino hides the complication of the hardware layer with simpler concepts, and the complexity of ht software with transparent instructions. Setting up a MCU's output using registers pose a certain degree of difficulty that even professionals need to look up the datasheet regularly, but Arduino does it with a single function.
* Thanks to its popularity and easiness and vast libraries, you only need to concern with the final product without knowing much about the protocols, datasheet, etc. These things make it more approachable for newbies and enable them to build amazing things without any prior electronics knownledge.
* On the other hand, not knowing enough is a drawback, the majority often find it impossible to handle issues outside the scope of the libraries.
* Prototypes made with Arduino are not durable, their purpose is to cut time-to-market.

=== Benefits of using Arduino

* IDE are designed to work well with many compilers and different hardwares without sacrificing for efficiency. For instance: Vanilla Arduino for AVR, but there are other versions for STM32, PIC32, ESP8266, ESP32, etc., optimising existing libraries.
* Libraries are developed upon top layer APIs, thus these can be reused for all chips. In particular, Arduino for ESP8266 can utilise over 90% of Arduino libraries.
* Arduino use C/C++ compiler. Did you know that ESP8266 non-os SDK and ESP8266 Arduino both use the same compiler? The end result is almost identical.
* C/C++ libraries are structured using OOP thus benefit from layering, inheritance, and good management in large projects. MCUs will become more powerful and its applications are huge. Prior management model in C will be tough.
* Projects for Arduino are always open source, you can use these for reference to your product for improvement and learn from the masters in the process
* Arduino emphasises multi-platforms, high modularity, which is suitable for complex and highly complex applications. These applications are real life issues. If you are not familiar with C++, or experience problem with overcontrol then give Arduino a try
* You can save a lot of time by focusing on what is important in these devices. Time is critical, so spend it wisely.

=== Arduino for ESP8266 & ESP8266 WiFi Uno Board

https://github.com/iotmakervn/iot-wifi-uno-hw[ESP8266 WiFi Uno Board] is a open source project that promotes a development environment for ESP8266 using Arduino. This allows you to write a Sketch with similar libraries and functions to those of Arduino that can run directly on ESP8266 and no additional MCU is required.

ESP8266 Arduino core are bundled with libraries for connecting WiFi that supports TCP, UDP and application protocols such as HTTP, mDNS, SSDP, DNS Servers. In addition, there are libraries for OTA firmware update, Filesystem running from Flash or SD card, servomotors, SPI, I2C peripherals.

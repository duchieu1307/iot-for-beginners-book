== Firmware update over the air

Firmware update OTA (Over the Air) is the process of uploading a new firmware onto ESP8266 module instead of using serial ports. This feature is very useful in cases of limited physical connect to ESP Module.

OTA is available on:

* Arduino IDE
* Web Browser
* HTTP Server

Using OTA with Arduino IDE option during development phase, testing, the rest 2 options is suitable for real application deployment, provide OTA update via web or by using HTTP server.

In all cases, OTA supported firmware need to be uploaded the first time via serial ports, if it works fluently, OTA logic applied properly then firmware update OTA is now possible.

There is not security guarantee for the OTA update what can be hacked. It is depends on the development company who ensure the legal and authorised update. When updating is completed, ESP8266 will reboot and execute the new code. Developers must make sure that real applications on module are terminated and restart safely. Bellow content provide additional information about security, and safety for OTA update process.

=== Security

When ESP8266 is allowed to perform OTA, that means it is wireless connected and be able to update the new Sketch. So, the ability of being attacked is higher and the probability of being flashed another code onto ESP8266 is more than higher. To reduce the risk of being attacked, it need to considering to protect your update with a password, stable fixed different port, etc.

Frequently check features provided by ArduinoOTA library, it can be upgraded the secure ability:

[source, c]
----
void setPort(uint16_t port);
void setHostname(const char* hostname);
void setPassword(const char* password);
----

Some secure features are already built-in and do not require any encryption from developers. ArduinoOTA and espota.py use Digest-MD5 to authorise uploading firmware. Simply ensure the integrity of firmware by calculating MD5.

Let's analyze the risk for your own application and base on your application to decide which features and libraries to execute. If need, consider to effectuate protecting procedure against hacked, for example OTA update only allowed to upload follow specific schedule, activating OTA is only when user press the dedicated button "update", etc.

=== Safety

OTA procedure consumes resource and bandwidth of ESP8266 when uploaded. After that ESP8266 is restarted and executes an new Sketch. It need to analyze and check the affect of this process to old features and the new Sketch of ESP module.

If ESP is placed far away and controlling some devices, we should take care on slave devices if it is unexpected stop due to update process. So that, we should confirm the normal working status of devices before update process. For example, module is used to control water supplier system in the garden. If during operation process, controlling system is suddenly terminated and valves are opened, then all the garden will be flooded.

Below functions are provided by ArduinoOTA library and used to handle applications during OTA update process or handle if OTA is failed:

[source, c]
----
void onStart(OTA_CALLBACK(fn));
void onEnd(OTA_CALLBACK(fn));
void onProgress(OTA_CALLBACK_PROGRESS(fn));
void onError(OTA_CALLBACK_ERROR (fn));
----

=== Fundamental requirements

Flash memory must has enough space for both the old sketch (operating the system) and the new sketch (OTA update).

Files and EEPROM are also need enough free space.

*Function* `ESP.getFreeSketchSpace();` is used to check the free space for the new sketch.

=== Update process - memory view

* The new sketch  will be saved in the free space between old sketch and spiff.
* In the next reboot, “eboot” bootloader checks command lines.
* New sketch will be copied.
* New sketch start.

== OTA using Arduino IDE

OTA update with Arduino IDE should be done only if:

* To upload firmware for ESP8266 module via WiFi without serial ports
* ESP8266 and PC which run Arduino IDE are connected to the same local WiFi network
* ESP8266 is successfully connected to WiFi network
* Supported OTA firmware is flashed via serial ports previously

Before start, it is needed to ensure that the latest version of Arduino IDE is installed, including ESP8266 pack for Arduino, and Python 2.7

=== Step 1: Upload OTA supported firmware via serial ports

Open sample sketch `BasicOTA.ino`. Open File > Examples > ArduinoOTA.

.Open OTA sample sketch

Provide the proper SSID and password of WiFi network for ESP8266 to connect

.Provide SSID and password
[source, c]
----
const char* ssid = "..........";
const char* password = "..........";
----

NOTE: Base on IDE's version and using ESP board, you can see ``Upload Using:`` in menu. This option will not take effect to your choice. This feature is compatible with older OTA versions and be uninstall in platform package version 2.2.0.

Upload sketch `Ctrl+U` When completed, open Serial Monitor `Ctrl+Shift+M` (reference <<arudino-term>>) and check if module is accessed to WiFi or not

.Check if ESP8266 module is accessed to local WiFi network or not

NOTE: ESP module should be resetted after complete uploading firmware


[source, c]
----
include::code-en/BasicOTA/BasicOTA.ino[]
----

=== Step 2: Chose uploading port via OTA

When module is successfully connected to WiFi network, after some seconds, esp8266-ota port will appear on Arduino IDE. Now you can totally remove the serial connection from the board to your computer. Arduino IDE can flash new firmwares via WiFi. chose the port with IP address as shown in the Serial Monitor at the previous step.

NOTE: If OTA port does not appear, you neet to close Arduino IDE and restart. Check the OTA port again. If OTA port still not appears, check the computer firewall and other configurations on router.

=== Step 3: Modify new firmware and re-upload via WiFi

After chose the correct OTA flash port, you are totally able to modify the new firmware and re-upload via WiFi, but need to notice that:

* New firmware must safely keeps the connection to WiFi (wrong-password-update for example)
* New firmware must contains the OTA initialize and OTA processing like <<ota-step1>>

=== Using password

Protecting OTA uploading process is quite simple. All you need to do is add the bellow code:

[source, c]
----
ArduinoOTA.setPassword((const char *)"your-password");
----

After that, re-upload the sketch again (using OTA). After completely compile and upload, password requirement window will be shown:

.Password for OTA
image::08-fota/ota-pass.png[width=300, role="center", align="center"]

Enter password, if correct, result is the notice `Authenticating...OK` and uploading process runs normally.

Next uplading times, Arduino IDE remember the password and does not ask again, except you change the OTA password, and the authentication step is not success, Arduino IDE will ask it again.

Keep in mind that password is easy to see, if IDE is not closed after the last uploading time. This can be done by `Show verbose ouput during: upload` in `File > Preferences` and upload to module.


=== Common errors

If OTA update is failed, the first step you need to do is check the error message at Arduino IDE's Log windows. If it can not help, let's upload again after check informations of ESP on serial port.


Popular causes of OTA error:

* There is not enough free space on chip (ESP01 with 512KB flash memory is not enough for OTA).
* Data zone for SPIFFS is too big, not enough space for firmware, in case you have 4MB Flash, this situation will not occur.
* Memory zize for firmware is too small, minimum size should be 512KB
* Do not reset ESP after the first uploading via serial port.

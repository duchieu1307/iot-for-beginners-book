== Firmware using Web Browser

When updating firmware using Web Browser, ESP8266 will lunch an HTTP Server, with an uploading form. When access the correct address, you will get an interface to chose binary file, and upload to chip. This is useful if not using Arduino IDE for updating, using the already available browser. Or integrate into an application which you might want to update in the future.

Updating via web browser is done by `ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer` library and 2 other libraries `ESP8266WebServer` and `ESP8266mDNS` for recognizing ESP8266 in the local network.

=== Implementation

Open sample: `File > Examples > ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer > WebUpdater`

[source, c]
----
include::code-en/WebUpdater/WebUpdater.ino[]
----

Provide the correct SSID, WiFi password you are using, flash firmware `WebUpdater` onto ESP8266 <<select-arduino-board>> and <<arduino-flash>>

NOTE: Notice that the computer should be in the same WiFi network with ESP8266

If you can not access to module ESP8266 via serial port, to recognize module's IP address in LAN, you can run the service mDNS on your computer. This service is already available in MacOS, however, in Linux, you should install Avahi: https://avahi.org/, and Bonjour for Windows: https://support.apple.com/downloads/bonjour_for_windows

With mDNS service on the computer, you can easily access to ESP8266 via http://esp8266-webupdate.local/update

By choosing file and press update, ESP8266 will update the new firmware you upload. This file can be exportd by `Sketch > Export compiled Binary`, and the .bin file will be placed in the folder of Sketch

NOTE: If you enter http://esp8266-webupdate.local/update but it is not affect, let's change esp8266-webupdate with the new IP address of module (you can find it at modem/router, or Serial Terminal). For example, if module's IP is `192.168.1.100` then the URL should be http://192.168.1.100/update. This method is useful incase of host software which installed at step 1 does not work.

If all above step works properly, on web browser and Serial Terminal (if opened) should look like this

=== Security

If you include WebUpdater into your product, of course you do not want any one else upload another firmware. Let's use the method `httpUpdater.setup(&httpServer, update_path, update_username, update_password);` with parameters username, password which you must enter the correctly to upload the new firmware.

Open the sample: `File > Examples > ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer > SecureWebUpdater` for details

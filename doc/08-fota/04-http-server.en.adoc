== HTTP Server

With 2 above methods, you can easily update Firmware via local WiFi network. However, when deploy real life applications, we need to update Firmware OTA via Internet, and need a server to stored firmware, and manage all versions.

A common scrip which usually being done is:

* When ESP8266 start (after an interval of time - 1 day for example), it will connect to server, provide it's current version
* When server relize that the current version should be upgraded, it return the new fimrware
* If current version of ESP8266 is not need to update, it return the 304 code.

In order to do this, we need to perform on both ESP8266 and from server side. Practice for this, we will use Node.js to built a server. You are surely execute this snippet code and assign for domain then access everywhere.

[[esp8266-ESPhttpUpdate]]
=== ESP8266 ESPhttpUpdate

By execute `ESPhttpUpdate.update("your-domain.com", 8000, "/fimrware.bin");`, ESP8266 will automatically connect to server at http://your-domain.com:8000/fimrware.bin to download the new fimrware. HTTP Status Code:

- (Code) 200: If the new firmware exists, and the file's content will be transfered accompanyly after that
- (Code) 304: Notice that there is no update available.

Snippet code can easily be found at `File > Examples > ESPhttpUpdate > httpUpdate`

You need to provide SSID, correct WiFi password, execute <<select-arduino-board>> and <<arduino-flash>>

<1> Your fimrware, assume that you modify as `2.0` and place on server, after that you undo to `1.0` and upload onto board
<2> The path to your firmware, web address, or domain

== Node.js OTA Server

When ESP8266 connected to web server. it provide Header's information and base on that, server evaluate the fimrware if it is needs to update or not. Headers example

[source, html]
----
[HTTP_USER_AGENT] => ESP8266-http-Update
[HTTP_X_ESP8266_STA_MAC] => 18:FE:AA:AA:AA:AA
[HTTP_X_ESP8266_AP_MAC] => 1A:FE:AA:AA:AA:AA
[HTTP_X_ESP8266_FREE_SPACE] => 671744
[HTTP_X_ESP8266_SKETCH_SIZE] => 373940
[HTTP_X_ESP8266_SKETCH_MD5] => a56f8ef78a0bebd812f62067daf1408a
[HTTP_X_ESP8266_CHIP_SIZE] => 4194304
[HTTP_X_ESP8266_SDK_VERSION] => 1.3.0
[HTTP_X_ESP8266_VERSION] => 1.0

Base on the knowledge at <<server-nodejs>>, we can build a OTA server using Node.js as below

.server.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::code-en/ota-server/server.js[]
----

Execute `node server.js` to start server

NOTE: When you work with different programing languages, always make sure that data send to client must contains enough header's information `Content-Length` and `x-MD5`

NOTE: You need `esp8266-firware-2.0.bin` file at folder <<esp8266-ESPhttpUpdate>> compiled with `currentVersion = "2.0"` which placed at the same folder with `server.js` file

If you follow all above steps, the result should look like this

In practice, when designing the application, we should notice that users usually need a user-friendly graphical interface with many useful functions such as chart or graph illustrations, data extraction in desired time intervals, the database storing or 1-click device states control from PC,... Many larger and more complex projects will also need different methods to manage their connections and data.

To help you deal with those problems, we will guide you build a temperature and humidity monitoring application with capabilities of sending data back to a given web server and displaying it on a website. This is a simple, useful and easy IoT application, which will provide us with some basics on sensors data collecting and web server building.


=== Requirements

- DHT11: Collecting the environment temperature and humidity data; Connecting and sending data to ESP8266.
- ESP8266: Connecting to a WiFi Access Point and sending data to an HTTP server; displaying data on Arduino terminal screen.
- Basic functions of HTTP server: Displaying current temperature and humidity on PC screen.
- Advanced functions of HTTP server: Storing sensor data; interpreting users' requests and returning a result HTML file to view on web browsers.


=== Project Analysis

- We will need a web server written in Javascript and implemented by Node.js and it will keep listening to a given port on PC. In this project, we are using port 8000.
- ESP8266 and your PC must connect to the same WiFi Access Point. ESP8266 also need to know your PC's IP to access the PC's server. In this project, our PC's IP is `192.168.1.102` .
- After successfully connected to a WiFi Access Point, ESP8266 will read the current temperature and humidity data from DHT11 and send to the server every 2 seconds.
- Using `GET` method, web server can receive data from ESP8266. For example, `http://192.168.1.102/update?temp=25&humd=80`, `192.168.1.102` is the web server IP address, `/update` is a path, `temp=20` and `humd=80` contain the temperature "20Â°C" and humidity "80%".
- Web Server returns the HTTP Status = 200 (OK) and displays a logging window with current temperature and humidity.
- Advanced Functions:
  -- Web Server saves data in an array variable in RAM.
  -- Web Server returns an `index.html` file to user with a special Javascript code to get the data stored in RAM and visualize it on screen.


=== Project-related Knowledge

It would be easier to understand if you already had some basics about:

 - Communicating between ICs with 1-Wire Protocol.

 - Using Javascript and Node.js to build a simple web server.

 - Building a simple HTML website to display sensor data.

However, do not get too worried when you have never done such things before, you'll understand them more thoroughly while reading the next parts.


**DHT11 Sensor and 1-Wire Communication Protocol**


* DHT11 is a widely used, low-cost and high-stability sensor and is usually used to measure the temperature and humidity of the environment. It uses 1-Wire Communication Protocol to send data to microcontroller. For more information, visit the manufacturer's datasheet:
http://www.micropik.com/PDF/dht11.pdf[*Datasheet*]

* 1-Wire is a device communication bus system designed by Dallas Semiconductor Corp. that provides low-speed data, signaling, and power over a single conductor. One distinctive feature of the bus is the possibility of using only 2 wires: data and ground. Like other communication protocols, a signal sequence of 1-Wire contains 3 steps: request -> respond -> data reading.

A detailed signal diagram is shown below:

Summary:

  1. If the Master (ESP8266) sends the `START` signal, DHT11 will transition from low-power mode to high-speed mode.
  2. DHT11 receives the signal and responds to the master, then the Master starts the data transmission.
  3. During a signal period, DHT11 sends a 40 bits data packet to the bus.
  4. If the Master wants to end the transmission, it will send a `STOP` signal and the process will stop.

**HTML Language**

A popular website to help newbies learn HTML is https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp[*w3school.com/HTML*]. But you shouldn't dive into learning HTML at this moment because it would take a long time to completely master it. You only need to learn some basic features of HTML to complete this project.

**Node.js and Javascript**

To create a Node.js server, you need to know some basics of Javascript and Node.js. To learn Javascript, you can visit https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp[*w3school.com/Javascript*].

== Server Nodejs
On Server side, we need to ensure that the server can serve many clients.
If `path` is:

* `/update`: server will add new sensor data to database and display it on the screen.
* `/get`: server will return a JSON string of stored data.
* `/`: return the `index.html` file.

* The structure of stored array on RAM: `[{"temp": 25, "humd":80, time: "time"}, ...]`

**`server.js` source code**

include::code-{lang}/server.js[]

**Explanation**

<1> `require` is used to load necessary modules or libraries.

* `fs`: This module helps us read file from server or upload file
* `url`: Divide URL into easy-to-access parts.
* `http`: HTTP Communication Protocol.
* `querystring`: Module have to convert string to object.
* `db = []`: An array variable to store temperature and humidity values.

<2> This function will respond differently depending on the `pathname`. If `pathname=/update`, this function will create a `newData` variable and get data in client's request. Then it will push data to `db` variable using `db.push(newData)` command and that data will be display on logging screen when using `console.log(newData)`. `Date()` function helps us get current time and date.

<3> Return the JSON format `('Content-Type': 'application/json')` of db variable if `pathname = /get`, then it deletes value of db. `response.end()` function returns HTTP code = 200 (OK)

<4> Return the `index.html` file if user doesn't use /update and /get. `fs` library is used to read `index.html` file and assign that file's content to `content` with `fs.readFile('./index.html', function(error, content)` command. `response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html' })` defines the HTTP code "200" and the response type "HTML" to read file on user's browser.

<5> Start the HTTP server and open port 8000 on server to listen for client's request.

Now, you should change to `server.js` directory and run `node server.js` on your terminal, then visit http://localhost:8000 on your web browser to view your `index.html` file. Or visit http://localhost:8000/update?temp=20&humd=60 to see the result on your logging screen.

{ temp: '20', humd: '60', time: 2017-08-21T16:57:06.277Z }
{ temp: '20', humd: '60', time: 2017-08-21T16:57:17.708Z }

While doing the basic function above, you don't need to understand the `index.html` and its Javascript code. Also, you've just handled the `\update` path, not `\get` or `/\*`. The `\update` is enough to run the basic function.
In the advanced sections, we are building a popular function of the application. That's the data visualization on user's web browser. To achieve that, we will create an `index.html` file with Javascript codes. Those Javascript codes will request server to return data every 2 seconds and illustrate it in graph.


**`index.html` file**
[source, html]
----
include::code-{lang}/index.html[]
----

**Explanation**

<1> Some basic tags to set up your HTML file in the beginning:
* `<!DOCTYPE html>`          : This is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
* `<html>`                   : Tell the browser that this is an HTML document.
* `<head>`                   : This is a container for metadata. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.
* `<meta charset="UTF-8">`   : Define the character set used:
* `<title>DHT11</title>`     : Define the title of the document.

<2> Use CanvasJS Chart to draw temperature and humidity graph.
<3> Create 2 text boxes in <h1> heading to display current value of temperature and humidity. Each text box has a unique `id` to get sensor data from server. The `&#176;C` means `Â°C`.
<4> Get data from server using this function.


**Graph Analysis**

* Using `<script> JS code </script>` tag in your HTML file, you can get data from server and visualize it in graph.
* You can get data by executing `httpGetAsync()` function. This function use `XMLHttpRequest` object to get data from server without reload webpage. Because the data `xmlHttp.responseText` returned from `localhost:8000/get` is formatted in JSON, you need to use `JSON.parse()` to convert it to `Object` type.


IMPORTANT: ESP8266 must have sent data to server, or localhost:8000/get won't return values.

* Use `window.onload = function()` to reload the graph, we have explained at the end of each line.

== Extending your application

=== ESP8266 Web Server

You should try to add some new features to the project. Here are some ideas:

* Measure and display temperature and humidity in real-time
* Illustrate in graph the sensor data over time.
* Have 2 modes: Auto and Manual.
** The Auto mode: turns your fan on automatically when the temperature > 35ÂºC or turn on a humidifier when the humidity is below 50%.
** The Manual mode: controls your fan and humidifier manually with ON/OFF switch on web interface.
* Display temperature and humidity history in a specified date interval, from aa/bb/cccc to xx/yy/zzzz.

This is an example of a graphical user interface:

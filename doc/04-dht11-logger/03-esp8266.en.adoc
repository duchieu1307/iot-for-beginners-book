== Code on ESP8266

ESP8266 uses HTTPClient library to make a connection and send DHT11 `temp` and `humd` data to web server via `GET` method.

=== Preparation:
- A local WiFi Access Point's SSID and Password.
- An IP and Port of Web Server.
- A library to help us get data from DHT11. Because of the popularity of the DHTXX sensors, many libraries have been released to support users. In this project, we are using the `DHT sensor library` of Adafruit.

<1> After successfully connected to server, ESP8266 will use `client.print()` command to send a data packet to server.
A packet example:
* GET /update?temp=30.6&humd=60 HTTP/1.1 :
** `GET` is an HTTP method, which is used to request data from a specified resource.
** `/update?temp=30.6&humd=60` is the data packet we want to send, it includes a pathname and sensor data.
** `HTTP/1.1` is the version of HTTP used in the project.
* `Host: 192.168.1.7:8000`: the IP and Port of server.
* `Connection, Content-Length`

After reviewing your source code:

You can use `curl` command to view the HTTP request headers and other things:
`curl -v http://192.168.1.7:8000/update?temp=28.0&humd=45.0`. Here is the output:

The result will be displayed on Arduino and PC logging screen.

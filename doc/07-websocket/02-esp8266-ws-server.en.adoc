== Using ESP8266 as WebSockets Server

In this article, we will configure application using ESP8266 as a WebSockets Server and browsers as WebSockets Client to update the status of a button, also control an LED on real-time board via web browser.

=== Requirement

* Launch a WebServer (WebSockets supported) on ESP8266 MCU.
* When access to IP address of ESP8266, it will return a HTML file including the content of Javascript that is create WebSockets connection to ESP8266, also listen to data packages from ESP8266 server.
* When press the button on board, ESP8266 will send the button's status to web browser to display with checkbox, pressed is checked, not pressed not checked.
* At the same time, when checkbox clicked on browser it will change status of the LED on ESP8266 board.

=== Prepare

Install libraries, for more information <<install-library>>:

* https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
* https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP

==== Introduction about ESPAsyncWebServer library

ESPAsyncWebServer is used to configure HTTP server and WebSockets server for ESP8266 module, and process events on server-client.

In order to use ESPAsyncWebserver and run applications, we need to use ESPAsyncTCP.

=== Javascript snippet code to create Web Socket connection

[source, javascript]
----
include::code-{lang}/client/client.js[]
----

=== Embedded HTML file include JS code into ESP8266

[source, html]
----
include::code-{lang}/client/index.html[]
----

=== Completed program for ESP8266

[source, c]
----
include::code-{lang}/websocket/websocket.ino[]
----

Execute after check the source code:

- <<select-arduino-board>>
- <<arduino-flash>>

=== Result

After completing compile code onto Arduino, open web browser, access into the IP address of ESP8266 returned on Serial Monitor with port configured on server, in this case is 192.168.1.65:8000

.Web browser can control ESP8266 via Web Socket

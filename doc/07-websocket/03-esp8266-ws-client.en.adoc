== Using ESP8266 as Websocket Client

In some other applications, we have a WebSockets server to perform real-time tasks such as mobile applications, web applications. In this case, ESP8266 can directly connect to these servers as a WebSocket Client to receive, or send data via WebSockets.

Some famous services use WebSockets such as messenger service https://slack.com[Slack], real-time database service https://firebase.google.com[Firebase]

In this part, we will use Node.js to build a Web server, it plays the roll of a WebSocket server. Which has features on:

* Provide the file `index.html` including javascript snippet code to create a WebSockets connection between browser and Server, it is like <<server-nodejs>>
* Allow WebSockets connections, from web browsers, or from ESP8266
* Server will broadcast all data packages from any client to all other clients.

With the features above, you can imagine like this: If web browser windows has WebSockets connections to Server, when a checkbox is checked, it send to server the checkbox status. For example `LED_ON`, after received, server will broadcast data `LED_ON` to all other browser (or ESP8266), and all other browser will display checkbox status as checked.

.Two browser windows will display checkbox's status the same when checked status changes

=== Websocket Client Javascript on web browser

With `index.html` file which includes Javascript code to create connection to WebSockets, placed in the same directory with `server.js`

.index.html
[source, html]

include::code-{lang}/server/index.html[]

=== Node.js Websocket Server
In this article, we use WebSockets library `ws` https://github.com/websockets/ws. You can install by run the command line:

`npm install ws`

.server.js
[source, javascript]

include::code-{lang}/server/server.js[]

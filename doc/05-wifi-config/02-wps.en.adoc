=== What is WPS?

This section will introduce the WPS concept, its usage and how to use it on ESP8266.

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS; originally, Wi-Fi Simple Config) is a network security standard to create a secure wireless home network and make it easy to add new devices to an existing network without searching and entering long passphrases. WPS is available to use only if both the router and your device support the WPA/WPA2 security protocol.

There are three primary approaches to network set up within Wi-Fi Protected Setup: push-button, PIN entry, and NFC - Near Field Communication (not popular yet). We are using push-button to set up WiFi in this tutorial.

Here is the process using push-button:

- First, push the WPS button on router and let it enter a special security mode. This mode allows connection requests from WPS-supported devices.

- Next, push the WPS button, either an actual or virtual one, on the wireless client device. This action allows that device to connect to a router using WPS. Routers from different manufacturers have a different timeout, usually from 1 minute to 5 minutes. If it takes too long and exceeds this timeout, the connection using WPS fails.

=== Connect to WiFi network on ESP8266 using WPS

The `WiFi.beginWPSConfig()` function in `ESP8266WiFi` library help ESP8266 to configure and connect to a network using WPS. This example will configure WPS on ESP8266 without any push-buttons.


[NOTE]
----
- You can only connect to wifi using WPS only if your ESP8266 is in STA (station) mode.

- WPS mode must have already been configured on your router.

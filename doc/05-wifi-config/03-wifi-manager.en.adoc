== Wifi Manager

The WiFiManager library allows you to easily manage the Wi-Fi connection in your ESP8266 projects via a user-friendly web interface. By starting the ESP8266 in access point mode (AP mode) with its own DNS and WebServer, you can connect to it using any WiFi device with a browser (PC, smartphone, tablet). Any connections to that AP will be redirected to a configuration portal. Using this portal, you can configure ESP8266 to scan WiFi, choose one of the APs scanned, enter password and save it for later use.


=== How it works?


- When your ESP8266 starts up, it sets it up in Station mode and tries to connect to a previously saved Access Point.

- If that connection is unsuccessful (previous APs are offline, or wrong password, or perhaps there is no known network available), it moves the ESP into Access Point mode and spins up a DNS and a Web Server (with default ip 192.168.4.1). This DNS typically points to itself, but you can configure it to point to another domain.

- You can use any wifi enabled device with a browser (computer, phone, tablet) and connect to that newly created Access Point. This AP's name is default and it doesn't require a password to log in:

- When the configuration portal of ESP8266's AP at "192.168.4.1" finishes loading, choose "Configure Wifi" or "Configure Wifi (no scan)" to set up a new WiFi connection:

- Choose a WiFi AP and enter its password.

- If success, the Web Server on ESP8266 will turn off and the ESP8266 AP becomes unavailable. If fail to connect, you need to reconnect to ESP8266 AP, choose another AP and repeat steps above.

== Smartconfig

=== Introduction

SmartConfig protocol helps users connect ESP8266 devices to a WiFi network through simple configuration on a smartphone. With this protocol, a smartphone sends UDP packets to the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP), and encodes the SSID and password into the Length field of a sequence of UDP packets. The ESP8266 device can reach those packets, decode the information, get the SSID and password from decoded data and connect it to the network.

We should know that, when a smartphone connects to a secured wifi network, all the data between your router and your smartphone will be encrypted during the transmission. So any other devices, which are not connected to the network at the beginning, cannot decrypt and read the data packets. So how can a smartphone app send the information to the unconnected devices directly? The solution is based on 2 things:

- ESP8266 is capable of `sniffing` out all the packets being passed around, even the encrypted packets!

- The content of an encrypted packet in a WiFi network cannot be read, but the length field of that packet is a constant and ESP8266 can reach that. For example, we have an unencrypted packet "A" with the length of `x`. When "A" is encrypted into "B", `x + n` is the new length of "B" and `n` is a constant.


Here is the ESP-TOUCH operation process sending SSID and password to an ESP8266 device:

* Enable SmartConfig function on ESP8266 device and it starts sniffing all the packets.
* Connect your smartphone to router.
* Input the router's SSID and password on phone app and it will broadcast a packet with random contents with encoded SSID and password in Length field.
- For example, you have a network with SSID `mynetwork`. The first letter `m` corresponds to `109` in ASCII code. To broadcast letter `m`, that app will send a packet which has random contents and a length of 109 to router. And the process is repeated to broadcast each letter in the SSID name. This method is also used to broadcast password, smartphone's IP address and other letters to ESP8266 devices.

*  ESPTOUCH protocol could encrypt transmitted data in the process above but the principle is the same.
*  ESP8266 devices will sniff out those packets whose length changes over time, then decrypt the data and extract the SSID,  password and other related information.
*  When ESP8266 has successfully connected to wifi network, it will connect to user's smartphone using the decoded IP address and send a message to notify the app of its successful connection.

NOTE:

 * It will take longer time to establish the connection with greater distance.
 * If the device cannot connect to the router within a specified time period, the App will return a configuration failure message. Users can define the overtime settings through `esptouch_set_timeout(uint8 time_s)` .
 * Your ESP8266 device should be configured as a STATION when it connects to network using SmartConfig.
 * Users can configure multiple devices to connect to the same router simultaneously.
 * ESPTOUCH supports 802.11n and 2.4GHz wireless routers .



=== Running SmartConfig on ESP8266


In the following example, our ESP8266 is connecting to a wifi network using SmartConfig and on Android, we are using `SmartConfig` app to input the SSID and its password. You can easily search for this app as well as other similar app on Play Store (Android) and iTunes (iOS).

First, you need to upload the compiled code to ESP8266. The key command in this program is the `WiFi.beginSmartConfig()` line and it's provided in ESP8266WiFi library. This command allows the device to enter SmartConfig mode, sniff out the desired packets and decrypt them to connect to a wifi network.

After uploading your sketch, you should hold the GPIO0 button in 3 seconds, the built-in LED will blink faster and your device will enter SmartConfig mode. Connect your smartphone to a desired wifi network, open `SmartConfig` app, input the SSID and PASSWORD (if any), and press **CONFIRM**.

= Hello World

Any learning journey should be taken slowly. As you first start, your knowledge and understanding about the field are limited. `Hello world` helps you with the basics: how to compile, how to upload the program, how to use libraries as well as get a hold of Arduino programming structure.

== Summary

Through some examples with LEDs, buttons and OLED, we can extend to other uses of GPIO in ESP8266, and gain some in-depth understanding on how Arduino IDE works, how to upload and use libraries, etc.
One application that makes use of said knowledge is Flappy Bird. You can try it out here: https://github.com/esp8266vn/arduino-flappybird[https://github.com/esp8266vn/arduino-flappybird]

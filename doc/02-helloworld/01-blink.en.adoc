== LED Blinking

=== Knowledge
**ED** = Light Emitting Diodes – a semiconductor that can emit light of different colours depending on its material. To control a LED, a voltage drop higher than Vf (datasheet) is applied between the cathode and anode of the LED, typically 3.2v, and a current lower than its maximum threshold, typically 15mA.

=== Digital IO

Pin name in Arduino (Pin number) is similar to ESP8266’s pin order. `pinMode`, `digitalRead`, and `digitalWrite` use the same Pin Number, for instance to read GPIO2, we call digitalRead(2).

GPIO0 to GPIO15 can either be `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, or `INPUT_PULLUP`. `GPIO16` can either be `INPUT`, `OUTPUT` or `INPUT_PULLDOWN_16`. After hardware reset, all pins are configured as INPUT by default. `INPUT`.

Each pin serves a particular function; for instance `Serial`, `I2C`, `SPI`. These functions will be configured accordingly using libraries.

`GPIO6` and `GPIO11` are not present as they are used to program Flash memory. Attempt to use these pins will result in errors.

TIP: Other boards and modules (i.e. ESP-12ED, NodeMCU 1.0) don’t have GPIO9 and GPIO11 since they are used for DIO mode in Flash, while ESP12 uses QIO mode.

GPIO Interrupt is supported with `attachInterrupt`, `detachInterrupt` GPIO Interrupt can be assigned to any GPIO except GPIO16 and it is also compatible with Arduino standard interrupt such as : `CHANGE`, `RISING`, `FALLING`.

=== Summary

Extended application

* Fading LED ( on or off gradually)
* LED blinking using Ticker

=== OLED display

OLED display (Organic Light Emitting Diode)  is a type of display composed of a film of organic compound situated between cathode and anode. It emits light in respond to an electric current. As it uses organic semiconductor, backlight is redundant, which is more effective than traditional LCD in terms of size and cost. Outdoor performance is decent compared to LCD.

=== SSD1306 OLED display

A small display ranging from 0.96 in to 1.25 in that is commonly seen in electronics. The driver MCU is SSD1306. This chip interfaces with external MCUs using I2C

=== I2C interface

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial interface developed by Philips for transmitting data between IC. I2C uses 2 transmission lines, one is serial clock (SCL) generated by a Master and another one is full-duplex serial data (SDA)

are required as shown in the figure. The nominal value is usually 4k7 or 1k2, depending on the speed and distance

=== OLED Display with ESP8266

**Step 1: Wiring** Connect GPIO4 of ESP8266 with SDA of OLED, and GPIO5 with SCL. Connect 3v3 with VCC and the GND for OLED. However, ESP8266 IoT Uno has default pin header for OLED, which is illustrated in the figure

**Step 2: Installing library** `ESP8266 and ESP32 OLED driver for SSD1306 display`, see more <<install-library>>

**Step 3: Programing** We will demonstrate a digital clock on OLED Display

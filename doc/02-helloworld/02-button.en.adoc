=== Knowledge
Buttons help the ESP8266 to activate a process when necessary. In many applications, we often require some sort of external trigger. Throughout this book, we will use buttons to activate some demonstrations as well as LEDs for status indication. In this part, pushing the button will change the LED status (from on -> of and vice versa).

This is a simplified demonstration, in reality, processing a button is quite complicated. Mechanical button often produces a chain of pulses (noise, bouncing, etc.). Usually a logic state of a pin should be maintained for 100 milliseconds to be considered stable.

Besides using interrupt for button detection – this method also helps conserve CPU resources, which only occurs when there is an expected event, there is another method called polling: This method requires the CPU to constantly check for the button status. However its responsiveness is inferior to that of interrupt.

NOTE: Requirement: button (GPIO0) for blinking LED (GPIO6) and print out to Serial port.

TIP: ESP8266 WiFi Uno with pre-built button on GPIO0

=== Some concepts
* **Interrupt** Interrupt is a hardware-related concept; an arbitrary event occurs, which requires the CPU to halt all on-going tasks to server the Interrupt routine. For instance, an interrupt is activated when there is a change from logic 1 to 0 (falling edge) of a GPIO, when the change occurs on that GPIO, CPU will immediately halt, save the main program’s context and jump to the Interrupt service routine to execute the instructions.
* **pull-up/pull-down** Most GPIO pins have 3 states, one is output high (logic 1), another one is output low (logic 0) and the last one is input. In input state, a GPIO assumes high impedance (Hi-Z) state or isolated state, no current can pass through although the pin can still sense voltage level. In this Hi-Z state, if no initial logic is defined, the GPIO will float, which means it is susceptible to external factors; when read it will not have a consistent logic state. Pull-up means pulling a resistor connected to a GPIO to logic 1, defining an initial logic level of 1 to ensure it remains that way unless externally modified. Similarly, pull-down defines GPIO’s initial logic level of 0.

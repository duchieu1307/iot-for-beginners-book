MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport and it is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.

These principles also turn out to make the protocol ideal of the emerging “machine-to-machine” (M2M) or “Internet of Things” world of connected devices, and for mobile applications where bandwidth and battery power are at a premium.

There are many free online resources to help gain an in-depth understanding of MQTT. In this section, we will introduce some basics of MQTT:
*"subscribe", "publish", "qos", "retain", "last will and testament (lwt)"*


=== Publish, subscribe

The clients in an MQTT system connects to an MQTT server called the broker. Each client has to *"subscribe"* to some topics. For example, "/client1/channel1", "/client1/channel2",... This process is similar to the subscription feature on Youtube. When each client *"publishes"* a message to the broker, the broker will deliver all messages with the matching topic to the client.

=== QoS

You will have 3 levels of *QoS (Qualities of service)* when you "publish" and "subscribe":

- *QoS0* : The message is delivered *at most once* to the receiver. This message is only guaranteed by the underlying TCP protocol and this is often called "fire and forget".
- *QoS1* : The message is always delivered *at least once* to the receiver. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment, the message is sent again until an acknowledgment is received. As a result, the same message can be sent multiple times, and the receiver might process it multiple times.
- *QoS2* : The message is always delivered *exactly once* to the receiver, and this QoS is a 4-step handshake transmission.

A message can be sent in any QoS mode and the clients can also subscribe in any QoS mode - i.e., the clients will select the highest QoS available to receive the message.

For example, if a message is published in QoS2 and a client subscribes with QoS0, the broker will send that message to client with QoS0. Another client, who subscribes to this topic with QoS2, will be sent with QoS2 from broker.

Another example, if a client subscribes with QoS2 and the message is sent in QoS0, that client will be sent a message in QoS0 from broker.

The higher QoS, the more reliability, latency and bandwidth.

=== Retain

If the retained flag is set to true, the broker *MUST* store the last retained message and the corresponding QoS. That message will be sent to every new subscriber in future. Each client that subscribes to a topic pattern, which matches the topic of the retained message, will receive the last message with RETAIN = 1 immediately after subscribing.
If the Broker receives a new message with QoS = 0 and RETAIN = 1, it will delete all stored retained message and save the new one. For each topic only one retained message will be stored by the broker.

When publishing a message to clients, the brokers must set the RETAIN to 1 to notify the successful subscribing to client (it is similar to the ACK message when the subscribing is successful). If we don't need to notify the result of subscribing process. set RETAIN to 0.

=== LWT

LWT messages are not really concerned about detecting whether a client has gone offline or not (that task is handled by keepAlive messages). LWT messages are about what happens after the client has gone offline.

*An example*

I have a sensor, which sends crucial data, but very infrequently. It has formulated a last will statement in topic: */node/gone-offline* with its unique *id*. I also have subscribed to the the topic *node/gone-offline*, which will send a SMS to my phone every time a message is published on that channel.

During normal operation, the sensor will keep the connection to the MQTT-broker open by sending periodic keepAlive messages. If the sensor goes offline, the connection to the broker will time out, due to the lack of keepAlives.

This is where LWT comes in: If no LWT is specified, the broker doesn't care and just closes the connection. In our case however, the broker will execute the sensor's last will and publish the LWT-message "id" to *node/gone-offline*. Because I have subscribed to that topic, the message will then be sent to phone and I will be notified of the sensor's ID via SMS so that I can check up on what's going on.

*In short*

Instead of just closing the connection after a client has gone offline, LWT messages can be leveraged to define a message to be published by the broker on behalf of the client, since the client is offline and cannot publish anymore.

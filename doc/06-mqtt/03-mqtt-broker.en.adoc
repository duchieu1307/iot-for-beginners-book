== MQTT Broker

At the previous part, we have practised free MQTT Broker services, but we may need to pay for service fee in case of huge application which require high bandwidth and high responsive, additionally data may be attached because of low level security. So, in this article, we will build a MQTT Broker ourself. By setting up a MQTT Broker helps us to use MQTT protocol locally without connection to MQTT Broker services on the internet. The sending, receiving and processing data will be performed in high speed, and securely protect user's information. However, to set up a MQTT Broker with full features of MQTT protocol require us a good knowledge on MQTT protocol and supported programming languages to build it up. To start up, we will create a simple MQTT Broker by using an exist supported module named `Mosca`.

=== MOSCA

Mosca is one of many MQTT Broker server of MQTT protocol. It can be list out other servers such as: HiveMQ, Apache Apollo, Mosquitto, Mongoose. Mosca has some special characters as below:

* It is a Node.js Broker, written by JavaScript then can build a MQTT Broker, we need Node.js to run. Mosca can embedded into your application if it is written by Node.js

* Mosce is a multi-transport MQTT Broker, means it supported all publish, subscribe features of other brokers. List of supported publish/subscribe brokers includes: RabbitMQ, Redis, Mosquitto, ZeroMQ. In this article we will create a simple MQTT Broker using Mosca with supporting by `Mongodb` database.

==== Objectives

* We will create a MQTT Client by ESP8266 and a MQTT Client on the computer by MQTT.js in order to connect to MQTT Broker, subscribing topics and publishing messages.
* Using Mosca to create MQTT Broker on personal computer to broadcast messages to MQTT Clients.

==== Performing steps

* **Step 1 :** First, we should create a folder to set up a MQTT Broker on local. Navigate to this folder, create package.js file by `npm init` command and configure project's information. Next, install mosca module by `npm install mosca --save` command. To listening connections from clients and saving data about connections and messages content, we need the `MongoDB`, you can choose Redis, Mosquitto, RabbitMQ, etc. and study about the advantages, disadvantages of these databases. To install MongoDB, we will access to https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/, base on your OS, choose the suitable installer package. After installation, we will open port 27017 (dafault port for using mongodb, we can change the port at configuration file of mongodb) to listening to connections from clients via
`sudo service mongod start` command. On Linux, connections on system can be checked by `Netstat` command as shown in bellow image:

* **Step 2 :** Create Javascript file to write the source code for MQTT Broker. Example of serverMosca.js file source code is written bellow:

==== serverMosca.js file source code

[source, javascript]
----
include::code-{lang}/mosca-server/moscaServer.js[]
----

* **Step 3 :** Write the source code for ESP8266. For quickly study, we will use ESP8266MQTTClient library's source code wrote at the previous article. Modify the MQTT Broker's address from `mqtt.begin("mqtt://iot.eclipse.org:1883");` to `mqtt.begin("mqtt://your-local-ip:1883");` with your-local-ip is the IP address of computer (ex:192.168.1.7), notice that ESP8266 and MQTT Broker must connect to the same local WiFi network.

* **Step 4 :** Create MQTT Client using MQTT.js. We will create a folder to containing MQTT Client's files. Similar to step 1, using `npm init` to create package.js file and configure project's information. Next, install mqtt module by `npm install mqtt --save` command and create the Javascript file to write the content of MQTT Client. Example of `moscaClient.js` file source code is shown bellow:

==== moscaClient.js file source code

[source, javascript]
----
include::code-{lang}/mosca-client/moscaClient.js[]
----

==== Result

On terminal, navigate to the folder contains `moscaServer.js` file and launch the server by `node moscaServer.js` command. Server will start and listen to connections from MQTT Clients. Next, load the program on Arduino to ESP8266, the run the MQTT Client on the computer by `node moscaClient.js` command. When there are connections, disconnection, publishing a message or subscribing a topic comes from clients then on server side will display the content and information. Terminals display the result as in the figure bellow:

=== Some MQTT Brokers used for real life products

==== Mosquitto

Mosquitto is a MQTT Broker written by C programming language. Some special characters of mosquitto is high speed of data transmission and data processing, good stability, widely used and suitable for embedded applications. Suitable for small systems run on local such as Raspberry Pi, moreover Mosquitto also supported TLS/SSL protocols (protocol for server and client authorising purpose, encrypting messages for data protection).

Some disadvantages of mosquitto are difficult to design when using for huge applications and poor of devices authority methods, so the ability of security is not optimized.

==== EMQ

EMQ (Erlang MQTT Broker) is a MQTT Broker written by Erlang programming language. Advantages of EMQ is high stability, suitable for design huge systems because of easy to expand the application, easy to install. Moreover, EMQ also support a bunch of users authentication methods, developing and features update frequently by developers community. But, disadvantages of this MQTT broker is difficult for new users. Information about EMQ can be seen at http://emqttd-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#

== MQTT Client

Như chúng ta đã tìm hiểu ở phần trước, 2 thành phần publisher và In the previous section, we have discovered 2 fundamental components of MQTT protocol: "publisher" and "subscriber". an MQTT Client doesn't transmit directly to other clients, every sent packet is distributed to an appropriate subscriber by an MQTT Broker. In this section, we are introducing some common MQTT Clients to demonstrate the MQTT concepts you have learned. We are also introducing some free and popular MQTT Broker: http://test.mostquitto.org and http://cloudmqtt.com.

=== MQTT Lens

**Overview**

MQTT Lens is a Chrome Extension and it uses Chrome to connect to an MQTT Broker and tests the publish/subscribe features of MQTT. This is a very useful tool to test the connection and transmission to an MQTT Broker.

Here are some information about MQTT Lens:

**Setup**

We will using this tools to connect to an MQTT Broker service at iot.eclipse.org in the following steps:

* Step 1: Install the Chrome Web Browser, log in to your Google account, visit https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions and type "MQTTlens" in the search box.

**Explanation**

We are adding a connection named "eclipse MQTT" to MQTT Broker host at `iot.eclipse.org`. This broker distributes data between clients and listens on port 1883( This port uses MQTT protocol and doesn't encrypt data. To use other ports, visit https://test.mosquitto.org for more information).
This connection subscribes to the topic `Home/garden/sensor/#` (The # symbol allows it to subscribe `Home/garden/sensor/1` , `Home/garden/sensor/2` , etc). Then we publish a packet with a message: `"Temp in garden: 27degree Celcius "` to topic `Home/garden/sensor/1` .

**Result**: In the Subscription panel, the MQTT Lens shows the received messages because it has subscribed to topic `Home/garden/sensor/#`

**Extensions**

Create more connections to subscribe and publish message with Eclipse Broker service and test the QoS and LWT.

=== MQTT.js

MQTT.js is an MQTT Client library written in JavaScript and Node.js platform. And it supports MQTT Over Websocket (MOW)

MQTT.js is an opensource project, you can get the latest release at https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js.git


**Setup**

Step 1: The first, you we have to check the the operating system supported by Node.js before install MQTT.js. Install Node.js before installing MQTT.js. You can download here: https://nodejs.org/en/

Step 2: Create a Node.js project:
We suggest creating a new folder for this project to store and conveniently manage NodeJS modules and .js file. Navigate to this folder and open Terminal (on Linux OS) or Command Prompt (on Windows OS) and run:

`npm init`

After running this command, you will have to provide some basic project information such as name, version, keywords, authors,... When you finish, a new file named `package.json` will be created in your project folder. This file contains the information you provided above and the package you will use later.

Step 3: Install `MQTT.js`:

Run:
`npm install mqtt --save`

When the installation finishes, you can use `mqtt` module to connect a Client to a Broker, publish message or subscribe to a topic. All the associated files of the `mqtt` module are stored in folder `node_modules` of project folder.
To understand how MQTT.js works, in next step, we are adding 2 new JavaScript files `client-a.js` and `client-b.js` to subscribe and publish messages.

Step 4: Create 2 new clients to subscribe and publish separately:

Those clients are connected to the same MQTT Broker. Client A subscribes to the topic `/client-a/sub` and if any messages are published to this topic, client A will publish message `Hello from client A` to topic `/client-b/sub` and then close connection and exit. The other client subscribes to the topic `/client-b/sub` and if any messages are published to this topic, client B will close connection and exit. After connecting to the broker, client B will immediately publish a message `Hello from client B` to the topic `/client-a/sub`.


**Client A's source code**

.client-a.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::code-{lang}/client-a.js[]
----

**Client B's source code**

.client-b.js
[source, javascript]
----
include::code-{lang}/client-b.js[]
----

The result is shown below:

.The result after running the clients' code
image::06-mqtt/MQTTjsConsole.png[width=511, align="center"]

Furthermore, MQTT.js provides many commands to interact with Broker via Terminal. To do this, you need to install MQTT.js as a global module by using:

`npm install mqtt -g`.

You can open 2 terminals to test the codes. The 1st terminal subscribes to the topic "topicA" by running:

`mqtt sub -t 'topicA' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -v`

The 2nd terminal publishes a message "Hello subscriber" to "topicA":

`mqtt pub -t 'topicA' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -m 'hello subscriber'`

The options:

    * `-t` : MQTT topic, pushlish a message.
    * `-h` : Specifies the server will connect
    * `-m` : Sends a message using the command line.
    * `-v` : verbose, The option allows you to record the activity log of the files in the configuration file.

NOTE: If you need help on other APIs of MQTT.js, run: `mqtt help [command]`.

=== ESP8266 MQTT Client

There are many MQTT library for ESP8266 on Arduino IDE and in this section, we are using 2 popular libraries: `PubSubClient` and `ESP8266MQTTClient`

==== PubSubClient

In this section, we are connecting ESP8266 WiFi Uno to a Broker using PubSubClient library.

* **Step 1 :** Download PubSubClient library at https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient and include it in the Arduino IDE. You can also import this library to Arduino IDE by searching the library with the keyword `PubSubClient`, author `Nick O'Leary` and install it.

* **Step 2 :** Compile the following source code for ESP8266.

[source, c]
----
include::code-{lang}/ESP8266PubSub/ESP8266PubSub.ino[]
----

**Source code explanation:**

We declare a `espClient` variable in `WiFiClient` class. It is an MQTT Client and use the attributes of `PubSubClient` library.

The `setup()` function configures the ESP8266 as a station and connects to wifi. In addition, the `setup ()` function will also auto-reconnect to MQTT Broker when a connection is lost. The `reconnect()` subscribes to the given topic and publishes its state to another topic.
The `callback()` function gets a message from publishers and then sent it the topic. The client, which has subscribed to that topic earlier, receives and checks the message to control the LED on GPIO16.

The `loop()` function connects the Client (ESP8266) to a Broker. Then it publishes a message and subscribes to a topic.

The `client.loop()` function tests the connectivity by using `KEEP_ALIVE` packet and returns a boolean value to notify the connection state. It also processes the incoming messages in the buffers and sends those to clients.


* **Step 3 :** Run MQTT lens on Chrome browser, add a new connection with hostname `broker.mqtt-dashboard.com` using port 1883. Publish messages to the topic `ESP8266/LED_GPIO16/status`. If the message is `ON`, the ESP8266 will light its  built-in LED up and vice versa. Other messages cannot control the LED state and will be displayed on the Arduino Terminal. The result is shown below:

.The result on Serial Terminal and on MQTT lens when using PubSubClient library.

==== ESP8266MQTTClient

The developer community reviews the ESP8266MQTTClient is more stable and easier to use than the PubSubClient library. The following project is using the ESP8266MQTTClient to control the built-in LED on ESP8266 WiFi Uno by a smartphone app.

* **Step 1 :** Download `ESP8266MQTTClient` library at https://github.com/tuanpmt/ESP8266MQTTClient and include it in Arduino. You can also import this library to Arduino IDE by searching the library with the keyword `ESP8266MQTT`, author `Tuan PM`, version `1.3` and install it.

* **Step 2 :** Compile the following source code for ESP8266.

[source, c]
----
include::code-{lang}/ESP8266MQTT/ESP8266MQTTClient.ino[]
----

*Source Code Explanation*

The `mqtt` variable is in class `MQTTClient` which is defined in ESP8266MQTTClient library. The library's functions are explained in the source code.

The `setup()` function configures ESP8266 as a Station and connects to a wifi network.

The `mqtt.onConnect()` function subscribes to the topic `esp8266/GPIO16`.

The `mqtt.onSubscribe()` publishes the messages to a specified topic `Broker/app`.

The `mqtt.onData()` receives, verifies and processes the messages from the subscribed topic. We use a public MQTT Broker `iot.eclipse.org` and Websocket protocol to listen for MQTT Clients on the default port 80. Transmission using Websocket can reduce the bandwidth and the latency when using MQTT. The detail on Websocket will be introduced later in this book.

In `loop()` function, we just need to call `handle()` to initiate and verify the attributes of protocol. The `handle()` also processes, sends and receives messages from public and subscribed topic.

NOTE: For more details on this library, visit https://github.com/tuanpmt/ESP8266MQTTClient/tree/master/src

* **Step 3 :** Install the app and use it to control LED.

Search on App Store (iOS) or CH Play (Android) and install the `IoT Smartconfig` app of `Tuan PM` developer.
Here is an overview of the app:

.IoT Smartconfig App on iOS and Android
image::06-mqtt/iotSmartConfig.png[width=600, align="center"]

This app can be used with ESP8266 or ESP32. Besides the basic `publish/subscribe` function of MQTT, this app can use `smartconfig` to easily configure different networks for ESP8266/ESP32 without recompiling the source code.

Next, swipe to the MQTT section and press the `connect` button to connect to the MQTT Broker server `ws://iot.eclipse.org:80/ws`. Subscribe to the topic `Broker/app` and publish the message to the topic `esp8266/GPIO16`. If the message is `ON`, the ESP8266 will light its built-in LED up and vice versa. Other messages to topic `Broker/app` will be displayed on the app screen. The result is shown below:

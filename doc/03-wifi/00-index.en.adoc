= ESP8266 WiFi

WiFi connection is ESP8266's selling point, it can connect to existing Router at home and Access Point with the most current standard in the 2.4Ghz frequency range - in STA mode. In addition, ESP8266 also supports AP mode (Access Point), i.e. it will initiate an Access Point and allow clients to connect, or it can run in mode STA and AP mode.

STA mode is frequently used in many applications, it will connect to a local WiFi with Internet enabled and send data to a server. Other occasions see it operating in AP mode, which is is programmed to exchange data between ESP8266 and a computer (or other device with a browser), e.g. controlling a LED using ESP8266 as a Web Server

WiFi Access Point is a central networking device in charge of directing data streams, e.g. process IP packets to identify LAN address, forwarding packets from the Internet to the stations.

A deviced connecting to an Access Point is called a Station. Any laptop or desktop with WiFi card connecting to an Access Point is identified as a Station.

All Stations when attempting to connect to a Access Point need to identify a desired `BSSID`, it is commonly called `SSID` when refering to a WiFi network. A list of nearby SSIDs can be scanned on a computer when using WiFi.

The following modes will be coverd in this chapter

* `Station - STA` mode connects to a existing Access Point.
* Using `HTTPClient` to request and receive data from the Internet.
* `Access Point - AP` mode allows connections from other clients.
* `Web Server` running on ESP8266 for toggling LEDs.

== Summary

In this chapter, we have gone through all ESP8266 modes, protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP and the HTML, CSS, Javascript trio languages. Other than some demonstrations using ESP8266 as a HTTP Client above, HTTPClient can connect to a custom-built server, send sensor data, as well as receiving data to process.

WiFi Access Point mode and Web Server running on ESP8266 are ususally used to configure products's specs. All computers with a web interface can access it and provice the applications with sophisticated data.

== HTTP Client

=== HTTP Protocol
`HTTP` - Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol for transmitting data among computers in the `www` (World Wide Web), the data can be text, file, image, or video.

HTTP is designed for data exchange between a client and a server using TCP/IP, the working principle is `request/respond`, and `stateless`. A web browser is a client, any machine that hosts web stie is a server. A client connects to a server, sends data composed which includes headers to it. The server receives it and responds based on what it gets, the channel is terminated after each connection.

For instance, when a URL is put in the address bar and `Enter` is pressed, the Web Client will immediately send the request to the Web Server with the provided address. The Web Server will then send back the content of the web page.

In HTTP protocol, connection is only made from the client side (or HTTP Client). When the client sends the request along with the *URL* and the payload (what to get) to the server. Server (HTTP Server) listens for any request from the client and responds accordingly. After that, the connection is terminated.

When talking about HTTP, Hyperlink, or URL (Uniform Resource Locator), is a common concept.

*URL* defines a website's address and contains the request details from the client, which the server uses to process. Its structure is as follows:

.A URL structure

For instance, sending a sensor data to a server can be done via: `http://esp8266.vn/log.php?nhiet_do=30`

.A URL structure
[source]
....

|scheme  | host      |port |path            |query                |fragment|
 http:// server.com: 8080  /path/to/log.php ?nhiet_do=30&do_am=80 #test
....
<1> `scheme` defines the protocol to communicate with the server, if it is `https` then it will be encrypted.
<2> `host` is the server's address.
<3> `port` is where the service is provided, if not defined then port 80 will be used.
<4> `path` information the client wants to get.
<5> `query` information the client wants to send.
<6> `fragment` this attribute directs the browser to a specific location.

With the above URL put into the address bar, the browser will initiate a connection and send the following information.

----
GET /log.php?nhiet_do=30 HTTP/1.1
Host: esp8266.vn
User-Agent: curl/7.49.1
Accept: */*

----

Received information:

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive

data
----

NOTE: On linux, curl can be used to digest raw data, type  `curl -v http://esp8266.vn/log.php?nhiet_do=30` in the terminal.

==== HTTP defines some methods for communicating with Server:

* `GET` is the most common and widely used method of HTTP. *GET* retrieves whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the URL, usually the Server returns the data based on the query information it receives without modifying it. `path` and `query` in the *URL* contains query information.
* `POST` Similar to `GET`, but `POST` can send data to the Server.
* `PUT` is a method for creating new resources, similar to `POST` but it informs the server that if the resource does not  exist, the server should create new resource or otherwise modify it.
* `DELETE` Similar to `GET`, but requests that the origin server deletes the resource identified by the URL.

Commonly used methods are `GET`and `POST`; other methods are utilised in API server (RESTful). Differences between `POST` and `GET`.

* `GET` can be cached (saved by the browser for future use), the requested content is stored in the history and can be bookmarked.
* `GET` should not be used to send sensitive information.
* `GET` is restricted in terms of data length.
* `GET` should only be used to query for data.

* `POST` is not cached, not saved in browser history, and cannot be bookmarked.
* `POST` does not limit the payload amount.

==== HTTP Header & Status Code

The response always include a header with the first line containing the Status Code `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, i.e. status code = 200, the response is valid.
It is then followed by header pairs with information that the Server wants to exchange with the Client, which is hidden from the users. These header pairs are defined as `name: value` and are terminated with invisible control characters (`0x0D 0x0A` or `\r\n`).
In the above example, the header `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8` informs the browser the return content is text, utf-8 encoding. `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` unknown data length, which is send until the server closes the connection.

Some common HTTP status code:

* *1xx*: Informational responses. An informational response indicates that the request was received and understood. These status code is defined in *HTTP/1.1*, which is not available in *HTTP/1.0* or previous versions. These status code can be ignored. Common status codes:
** *100 Continue*: Informs the client that it can continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, ignore this response. In a POST request, the server will reject it if the body is too large. To resolve this, the client must send *Expect: 100-continue* after the initial header.
* **2xx**: Success. This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood, accepted, and processed successfully. Common status codes:
** *200 OK*: The request has succeeded. This can be seen in these methods *GET*, *HEAD*, *POST*, *TRACE* .
** *201 Created*: The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource. This is used to verify *PUT* or *POST* success.
** *204 No Content*: The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.

* **3xx**: This class of status code indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request. Common status codes:
** *301 Moved Permanently*: The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs.
* *4xx*: These are intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client. The server assumes that the Client is experiencing errors with a request or an invalid resource. Common status codes:
** *400 Bad Request*: The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
** *401 Unauthorized*:The request requires user authentication. The client can re-send the request a validated header. If the header includes the authentication but is still refused then the authentication data is wrong.
** *403 Forbidden*: The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
** *404 Not Found*: The resource is invalid or cannot be found on the server.
** *409 Conflict*: The Server cannot complete the response because the Client intentionally modify a resource that is different to *timestamp* của Client. Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request.
* *5xx*: These code indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the request. Common status codes:
** *500 Internal Server Eror*: The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
** *501 Not Implemented*: The server does not recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.
** *503 Service Unavailable*: Occurs when the server is under maintenance or overloaded.

=== JSON

is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

JSON is built on two structures:

* A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.

**Syntax**

* An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs.
* Values are separated by , `,`
* An object (name/value) starts and ends with `"`
* All objects reside inside a pair of `{}`
*  JSON data is grouped into pairs of name/value. Each name/value composes of a `name` field ( lies inside a `"`, followed by a `:`, then `value`field comes next (also lies inside a `"`. For instance: `"name":"John"`

=== Bitcoin value monitoring application

A simple application using HTTP to get Bitcoin (BTC)/USD rate form exchange market web, then display on the OLED.

There are many sites to choose from, for instance https://www.cryptocompare.com/. With the provided information, and the objective is to get the exhcnage rate of Bitcoin/USD, ESP8266 will send a HTTP Request to https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=BTC&tsyms=USD and get back a JSON packet as follows:

[source, json]
----
{"USD":4731.44}
----

The `USD` field is the desired data.

NOTE: Most websites now offer `HTTP` encryption, basically it's still HTTP, but the transmission process is encrypted, and verification is done before the request is sent.

When using HTTPS, SHA1 Fingerprint must be provied so that the Client can verify the Server. A browser can be use to access it in advance. In `Chrome`, after connecting to https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=BTC&tsyms=USD, press Ctrl+Shift+I (Shift + ⌘ + I in MacOS), proceed to `Security > View Certificate > Details > Thumbprint`. The result will be as follows.

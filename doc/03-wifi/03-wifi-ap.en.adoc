=== ESP8266 in Access Point Mode

ESP8266 allows other devices (Station - STA) to connect when operating as an Access Point. It can initiate a local WiFi network with DHCP Client enabled to assign IP to connected Clients. Due to RAM constraints, maximum number of STA concurrent connections is 5.

==== Initiate a network

`<ESP8266WiFi.h>` is needed, this library contains `softAP` which is used to configure soft Access Point (soft AP) for a WiFi network.

A simple WiFi network only needs to provide SSID without password `WiFi.softAP(ssid)`. If a password is desired, `WiFi.softAP(ssid, password)` can be called. More options are available using `WiFi.softAP(ssid, password, channel, hidden)`, default channel is 1 and initially hidden, which can be made invisible by setting `hidden = true`

`ssid` should not exceed 63 characters, and the (optional) password is at least 8 characters long for WPA2-PSK

`softAP` will return `true` if the WiFi network is successfully established

NOTE: Remember that the WiFi network created by calling `softAP` will have a default IP of `192.168.4.1` and run a DHCP Server to provide connected clients with IP in the `192.168.1.x` range. The default IP can be modified by calling `softAPConfig`. Moreover, ESP8266 can operate in both Station and Access Point modes. Take note that the two modes operate on the same channel, softAP channel will be utilised by Station mode.

`WiFi.softAPConfig (local_ip, gateway, subnet)` is used to modify Access Point IP.

.Modify ESP8266 AP's IP to `192.168.4.22`

IPAddress local_IP(192,168,4,22);
IPAddress gateway(192,168,4,9);
IPAddress subnet(255,255,255,0);
WiFi.softAPConfig(local_IP, gateway, subnet)

`WiFi.softAPgetStationNum()` returns the number of clients connecting to the Access Point

=== Establish WiFi network using ESP8266

With the following code, a local WiFI network with a SSID of `AP-XXXXXX` is established and available for connection for computers using the `password` password
